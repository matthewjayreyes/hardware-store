# Hardware Store using Python

### As a capstone project at the end of my business programming course I led a team project to create a store using the pandas library. The project helps shoppers browse through departments, items, its price, and completes the purchase.

### The file titled "Hardware Store Final Project.py" contains the digital hardware store.

### The data created is stored in an Excel sheet title "Team_DB.csv". Before running the code, its important to first set the directory to where the data is located on your device before running the code.
