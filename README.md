# Hardware Store using Python

### As a capstone project at the end of my business programming course I led a team project to create a store using the pandas library. The project helps shoppers browse through departments, items, its price, and completes the purchase.

### The data created is stored in an Excel sheet title "Team_DB.csv". When importing the data its important to first set the directory to where the data is located on your device.
